# Text Recognition from Image using OCR & ML Techniques

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE.txt)

This project implements a text recognition system that extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The system combines the power of ML algorithms with the accuracy of OCR engines to extract textual information from various types of images.

## Features

- **Image preprocessing:** Enhance the quality of input images to improve OCR accuracy.
- **OCR integration:** Utilize the Tesseract OCR engine to extract text from preprocessed images.
- **ML model training:** Train and fine-tune ML models to enhance text recognition performance.
- **Evaluation metrics:** Assess the accuracy of text extraction using evaluation metrics.
- **User-friendly interface/API:** Easily integrate the system into other applications.
- **Scalability:** Deploy the system in production environments with ease.
